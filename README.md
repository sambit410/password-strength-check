# password-strength-check

1. Password Creation

Generated multiple passwords with varying complexity, incorporating uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and different lengths.
Passwords created:
K7@mP9#n (8 characters)
Tr0ub4d0r&3x (12 characters)
9z$Qw2!vB8mN&pL5 (16 characters)
X7#kM9nT@r5Qw!2zP&8v (20 characters)
J$2mP9#vN6!xT5@kL3qW&8rZ (24 characters)



2. Password Strength Testing

Tested each password using the PasswordMonster tool to assess strength, crack time, and feedback.
Results:
K7@mP9#n: Strong, 2 years to crack
Tr0ub4d0r&3x: Very Strong, 88 centuries to crack
S4#k5cg90!: Very Strong, 96 thousand years to crack
9z$Qw2!vB8mN&pL5: Very Strong, 17 thousand trillion years to crack
X7#kM9nT@r5Qw!2zP&8v: Very Strong, 10 trillion trillion years to crack



3. Best Practices

Identified key practices based on evaluations and research:
Use 12â€“16+ characters, with 20+ for high-security needs.
Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid dictionary words, patterns, or personal info.
Ensure uniqueness across accounts.
Utilize passphrases and password managers.
Avoid common substitutions and update passwords regularly.
Pair with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).



4. Tips Learned from Evaluation

Prioritize length over complexity for stronger passwords.
Avoid dictionary-based words, even with substitutions.
Use password managers for managing complex passwords.
Regularly test passwords with strength checkers.
Balance memorability and security with passphrases.

5. Researched on Common Password Attacks

Brute Force Attacks: Systematic guessing of all combinations, mitigated by longer passwords.
Dictionary Attacks: Use of common words and variations, countered by random, non-dictionary passwords.


7. Report Generation

Compiled a detailed report summarizing best practices, evaluation tips, attack research, and security impact.
Included findings in a structured Markdown document for easy reference.

Conclusion
This task demonstrated the importance of password length, randomness, and supporting tools in securing accounts against brute force and dictionary attacks. The evaluations highlighted that passwords of 16+ characters with diverse characters offer robust security, while shorter or predictable passwords remain vulnerable.
